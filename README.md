# Bubble sort algorithm  

> Sorting algorithms are some of the earliest that you typically get exposed to in Computer Science. It may not be immediately obvious how important they are, but it shouldnâ€™t be hard to think of some examples where your computer needs to sort some massive datasets during everyday operations.


In this project, we have written a bubble sort algorithm, split into two methods. The first one is going to sort smallest to highest and the other one is going do the same with `yield` and `block` part. 

## Built With

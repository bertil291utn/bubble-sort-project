# Bubble sort algorithm  

> Sorting algorithms are some of the earliest that you typically get exposed to in Computer Science. It may not be immediately obvious how important they are, but it shouldnâ€™t be hard to think of some examples where your computer needs to sort some massive datasets during everyday operations.


In this project, we have written a bubble sort algorithm, split into two methods. The first one is going to sort smallest to highest and the other one is going do the same with `yield` and `block` part. 

## Built With

- Ruby 2.6

## Getting start

In order to start with the project:

1. You need to have ruby environment installed. [Click here for instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
2. Clone this repository `https://github.com/bertil291utn/bubble-sort-project.git`
3. Run the algorithm file
    - In a terminal window write `ruby `*`[your_file_path]`*`buble-sort-algorithm.rb`
